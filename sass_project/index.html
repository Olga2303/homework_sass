                <p>While some might be tempted to squeeze a large table into the formal dining room, Kara quickly discovered that smaller was better. Adding this statement piece surprisingly helped the flow of the space too -  making it a practical as well as beautiful choice for the room. The petite chandelier is a fun play on scale, and keeps the table as the focal point. The custom linen shades from Wovn Home provide beautifully filtered light into the space.To compliment them, she's layered in touches of Moroccan rugs and pillows, creating a quietly eclectic space. My personal favorite element in here might be the coffee table whose smokey glass top combined with brass really elevates the room.In the living room, basic modern furnishings are combined with pieces that Kara has brought back from travel. She showcases them on her bookshelf, where they really.I can't wait to share all the gorgeous goodies with you! In the meantime, our winter collection arrived in January, and will be on the site through March, so head over to see some of the beautiful new additions!We're a little behind in popping this news, but I've been working hard this past month to pull together our first pop-up shop of 2021, featuring items from my own shop as well as some talented friends. Last year's holiday shop was such a success, that I felt motivated to keep things going. So, here's the deal. I will be hosting a series of pop-ups through out the year - every other month - and have decided to call it 'Six Stories'. </p>

                <P>Each pop-up will have a bit of its own 'story', and this month - well - obviously we'll be celebrating Valentine's Day! That means you can expect a small collection of happy pink goods, as well as lots of self-care items and gifts to send your besties to show them some love. This new curation will launch Feb 11th, online and in-person.Every shop will also include my studio mate Hayley of Neon Doves, as well as other vendors and a featured local artist who will rotate through.</P>
